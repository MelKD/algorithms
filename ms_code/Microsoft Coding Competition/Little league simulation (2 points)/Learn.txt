In this problem, you will model a simple little league game in which there are a fixed set of outcomes for a given type of pitch and swing. We will assume that little league pitchers throw only two types of pitches Fastball(FB) and Changeup(C). We also assume that little league batters swing at two speeds Fast(F) and Slow(S). For this problem, we will use the following pitch, swing, and outcome tuples

(FB, F, Homerun)
(C, S, Hit)
(FB, S, Strike)
(C, F, Strike)
The rest of the simulated game largely uses normal baseball rules

A hit resets the strike count to zero.
If four hits are obtained in a row, a run is scored and the count of hits is decremented.
A homerun results in n+1 runs, where n is the number of hits and the hit count returns to zero.
If three strikes are obtained in a row, an out results.
Three outs end the inning and the simulation (further data can be ignored).
Input definition
An input file for this problem will contain a list of play tuples, containg a pitch (FB or C) and a swing (F or S). The tuples will be grouped by parenthesis and be comma and space separated. The full set of plays will be enclosed in a pair of parentheses.

Output definition
Your output should be the integer number of runs scored in the inning represented by the input.

Example input
((FB, S), (C, F), (FB, S), (FB, F), (C, S), (FB, F), (C, F), (FB, S), (C, F), (C, S), (FB, F), (C, S), (FB, S), (C, F), (FB, S))
Example output
